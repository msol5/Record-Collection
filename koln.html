        <p>My favorite jazz record of all time. Also the greatest selling solo piano record of all time. Folky, creative, and full of character. <br>
            He performed it on an out of tune piano, and requested that it be recorded so event planners would never give him an out of tune piano again. <br>
            But it went extraordinarily well. </p>
