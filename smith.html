        <p>Once again the final project from an artist, it's a collection of recordings from 1994-1997 put together by his family and friends.</br>
        Really relaxing for the most part, and when it isn't, it's just engaging songwriting. Covered a few times by me and some of my favorite jazz people.</p>
